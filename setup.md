## Install Git
Since several Carpentries lessons rely on Git, please see
[this section of the workshop template][workshop-setup] for
instructions on installing Git for various operating systems.
- [Git installation on Windows][workshop-setup-windows]
- [Git installation on MacOS][workshop-setup-macos]
- [Git installation on Linux][workshop-setup-linux]

## Prepare Your Working Directory
We'll do our work in the `Desktop` folder so make sure you change your working directory to it with:

~~~
$ cd
$ cd Desktop
~~~
{: .language-bash}
